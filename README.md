# Tradable-Bonus
At Imperial Markets, we are committed to empowering traders with the tools, incentives, and opportunities needed to succeed in the fast-moving world of financial markets.One of the most exciting offerings we provide to both new and existing clients is our Tradable Bonus Program — a unique and valuable promotion designed to boost your trading power from the very first deposit. With this bonus, Imperial Markets demonstrates our belief that every trader — whether novice or professional — deserves enhanced capital and flexibility without unnecessary limitations. 
What Is the Tradable Bonus?
The Tradable Bonus offered by Imperial Markets is a reward credit provided automatically when you fund your trading account. This bonus is tailored to support your trading journey by increasing your margin balance, enabling you to take advantage of market opportunities you might otherwise miss. It is structured to be simple, transparent, and aligned with your trading goals.
Imperial Markets understands that access to trading capital can make a significant difference in a trader’s ability to diversify positions, manage risk, and pursue strategic opportunities — especially in highly volatile markets. Our Tradable Bonus is designed with exactly this in mind, helping traders maximize their engagement in global markets. 
Generous and Scalable Bonus Structure
We tailor the Tradable Bonus according to account types to ensure the most relevant support for your trading style:
•	Micro & Standard Trading Accounts enjoy bonus validity for up to 45 days. 
•	Classic & Swap-Free Accounts benefit from up to 60 days of bonus applicability. 
•	Premium Accounts receive an extended window of up to 90 days for full utilization. This structure enables you to plan and execute your trading strategy with confidence. 
•	The flexibility we offer is part of our commitment to supporting different trader profiles and helping every client take full advantage of our resources. 
•	Simple, Client-Focused Eligibility
We believe incentives should be straightforward and accessible. That’s why:
•	Every first deposit, as well as subsequent deposits or re-deposits, qualifies for a 20% Tradable Bonus by default. 
•	For your first trading account, you can receive an even more generous 30% Tradable Bonus — giving you more trading capital right from the start. 
•	Additional trading accounts still receive a 20% bonus, ensuring that diversification across multiple accounts remains highly rewarding. 
•	Clients can receive up to $5,000 USD in bonus credit per trading account, giving substantial added power to their trading activities. 
This flexible bonus system is crafted to reward active engagement with Imperial Markets and empower traders with capital that can significantly enhance market exposure. 
Bonus Designed for Trading — Not Just Sitting Idle
One of the greatest advantages of the Imperial Markets Tradable Bonus is that it is purely built for trading. While the bonus funds cannot be withdrawn directly, they can be fully utilized to open new positions, increase leverage, and respond robustly to market movements. Any profit generated using the bonus can be withdrawn — putting real value into your hands as you trade. 
Unlike static incentives that sit dormant in a balance, our Tradable Bonus actively contributes to your market presence. Whether you’re jumping into forex pairs, commodities, or CFDs, this boost means more trading opportunities with the same capital base. 
Reliable and Transparent Terms
We know that trust is key in financial markets, which is why we’ve made our Tradable Bonus easy to understand and transparent:
•	Your bonus remains valid as long as your principal amount is in the trading account. 
•	You are free to withdraw your profits at any time without impact on your bonus eligibility. 
•	Trade Bonus will not be cancelled if your account equity drops below the principal — a supportive feature that gives more breathing room as you explore market opportunities. 
•	We also make sure that basic account management remains unaffected — you can cancel the bonus at any point, simply and easily. 
This customer-centric approach is designed to promote clarity, flexibility, and a sense of control over your trading account.
